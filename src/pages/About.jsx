        <p>
          Established in <strong>2025</strong>, Brewed Bliss started as a small passion project
          among friends who believed that coffee is more than just a drink — it’s an experience. Our
          goal has always been to bring people together through the warmth and aroma of perfectly
          brewed coffee.
        </p>

          We source our beans from sustainable farms across South America and Asia, ensuring each cup
          supports fair trade practices and high-quality production. Every sip reflects our dedication
          to sustainability, community, and craftsmanship.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our team of skilled baristas takes pride in experimenting with new blends and brewing
          methods, offering something exciting for every kind of coffee lover.
